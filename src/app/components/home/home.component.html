            <h3>Welcome to the planet of Lengaburu!</h3>
            <p>
                After the recent Falicornian war, King Shan has exiled Queen Al Falcone for 15 years.
                However, if he finds her before the 15 years are up, she has to go into exile for another 15 years!
            </p>
            <p>
                King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets
                - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor.
                However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these planets.
            </p>
            <p>Your task is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.</p>
